## 🧠 What is Node.js?

> **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime environment built on **Chrome's V8 engine**.  
It allows JavaScript to run **outside the browser**, enabling backend development, CLI tools, and more!

## 🌟 Key Features

<details>
<summary><strong>1️⃣ Runtime Environment</strong></summary>

- Node.js executes JS code **outside the browser**.
- Powered by the **V8 engine** (used in Chrome).
