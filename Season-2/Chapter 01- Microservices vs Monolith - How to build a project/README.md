# 🏗️ Microservices vs Monolith — How to Build a Project

## 🧰 Software Project Development in the Industry

### 🔄 Waterfall Model Overview
The **Waterfall Model** is a sequential software development approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It is commonly used for structured and well-defined projects.

---

### 🔹 Steps in the Waterfall Model

#### 1. **Requirement Gathering**
- Understand and document all functional and non-functional requirements.
- Gather input from stakeholders to ensure clarity.
- 👤 **Roles**: Business Analysts, Project Managers, Stakeholders, Product Owners

#### 2. **Design**
- **Architectural Design**: High-level structure of the system.
- **Detailed Design**: Component-level specifications.
- 👤 **Roles**: Solution Architects, UI/UX Designers, Technical Leads

#### 3. **Development**
- Coding begins based on the approved design.
- Modules are developed and integrated.
- 👤 **Roles**: Developers, Backend/Frontend Engineers, DBAs, DevOps

#### 4. **Testing**
- Perform various testing types: unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
- Ensure quality and fix bugs.
- 👤 **Roles**: QA Engineers, Test Leads, Automation Testers

#### 5. **Deployment**
- Release the product to a live environment.
- Provide user training and configure systems.
- 👤 **Roles**: DevOps Engineers, System Admins, IT Support

#### 6. **Maintenance**
- Provide bug fixes, updates, and enhancements.
- 👤 **Roles**: Maintenance Teams, Developers, Support Engineers

## ⚙️ Project Architecture Strategies

### 🧱 Monolith Architecture
- Single codebase; all features live in one tightly integrated system.
- Simple deployment (one unit).
- Best for small-to-medium projects or MVPs.

### 🧩 Microservices Architecture
- Application is split into independent services, each handling a specific functionality.
- Each service can be independently developed, deployed, scaled, and maintained.
- Ideal for large-scale systems with modular team structures.

## 🔍 Side-by-Side Comparison

| Parameter            | 🧱 Monolith                             | 🧩 Microservices                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Dev Speed**        | Faster for small apps                   | Slower initially due to setup            |
| **Code Repo**        | Single repo                             | Multiple repos                           |
| **Scalability**      | Whole app must scale                    | Scale services independently             |
| **Tech Stack**       | Usually one tech stack                  | Flexible per service                     |
| **Infra Cost**       | Lower (simple infra)                    | Higher (infra overhead)                  |
| **Complexity**       | Simple at first, complex as it grows    | High due to distribution                 |
| **Fault Isolation**  | One crash can affect all                | Isolated; one crash ≠ system crash       |
| **Testing**          | Easier full-app testing                 | Service-level + integration testing      |
| **Ownership**        | One team owns all                       | Multiple teams own parts                 |
| **Maintenance**      | Easy for small, hard when big           | Easier long-term if well-planned         |
| **Revamps**          | Risky, affects entire app               | Safe, localized revamps                  |
| **Debugging**        | Easier at small scale                   | Needs better logging/monitoring          |
| **Dev Experience**   | Great for small team                    | Great for large, independent teams       |

## ✅ Conclusion

- 🧱 **Monolith** is ideal for **startups**, **POCs**, or **simple applications** where rapid development and centralized control are priorities.
- 🧩 **Microservices** are better for **large-scale**, **modular**, and **enterprise systems** that need **flexibility**, **scalability**, and **team independence**.

> 🚀 The choice depends on your **team size**, **future goals**, and **project complexity**.
