- Download for your OS and install

### 📂 Step 2: Create a JS File

- Open VS Code
- Create a new file → `Ctrl + N`
- Save it as `app.js` → `File > Save As > app.js`

### ✍️ Step 3: Write Basic Code

In `app.js`, type:

## 💻 Running JS Code via Command Prompt (Windows)

### 🔓 Step 1: Open CMD

node app.js
```

And your terminal will print:

```
Hello from CMD!
```
